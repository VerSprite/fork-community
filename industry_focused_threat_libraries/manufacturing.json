This can lead to significant safety risks, costly recalls, and damage to the manufacturer's reputation. The motive behind introducing such defects could range from economic sabotage aimed at undermining a competitor, to creating a market for counterfeit replacement parts, or even to compromising the safety and security of critical systems in a targeted attack.",
