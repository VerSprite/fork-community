This can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as calibration errors, software bugs, malicious tampering, or cyberattacks targeting the monitoring systems. Such inaccuracies can lead to inflated energy costs, misinformed decision-making, and potential damage to equipment due to unnoticed overuse. It's crucial for companies to regularly audit and calibrate their monitoring systems and implement cybersecurity measures to protect against unauthorized access and data manipulation.",
