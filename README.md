# Fork Community - A free online SaaS tool to build risk centric threat models using the P.A.S.T.A threat modeling methodology as well as a repo for free, curated and researched threat libraries by industry.  

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for the [Fork](https://forktm.com) Community Edition, an implementation of the [PASTA](https://versprite.com/blog/what-is-pasta-threat-modeling/) (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) threat modeling framework. This repository aims to provide a collaborative space for enhancing and expanding the capabilities of Fork through community contributions.  This repo consolidates the prior repo where attack trees were shared by VerSprite here (https://github.com/VerSprite/threat-modeling.github.io) but have now been consolidated into the threat libraries folder, here: https://github.com/VerSprite/forkTM/tree/main/threat-libraries.    

## What is Fork?
[ForkTM.com](https://forktm.com) is SaaS platform that implements the PASTA framework for threat modeling. It is designed to be flexible, adaptable, and easy to integrate into existing security processes. Our goal is to create a tool that not only serves the needs of security professionals but also evolves with the contributions of the community. The community version is freely available and designed with extensibility in mind, allowing the community to contribute and enhance various parts, whereas the enterprise edition, currently under development, aims to cater to organizations with more advanced functionalities and tailored features.

## Features
- **Issue Tracker**: A dedicated system for reporting issues, suggesting enhancements, and discussing project-related matters.
- **Community Contributions**: Members can contribute to JSON files that constitute the basis of a threat library, which are integral to Fork's functionality.
- **Automatic Updates**: Changes to the JSON files that pass the peer-review process will be reflected in the platform with each new release, ensuring up-to-date threat modeling capabilities.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone git@github.com:VerSprite/forkTM.git`
